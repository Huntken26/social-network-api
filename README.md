## INSTALLATION:

Before you begin make sure that you clone the github repo ``git clone repo`` with the SSH key. Also make sure to have mongoDB/compass on your machine.

## USAGE/INSTRUCTIONS:

1. You can begin by opening two seperate CLI terminals. Within the first terminal enter ``npm install`` <br/>


2. Within the secondary CLI enter ``mongod`` or ``mongosh`` (depending on the version you have) to get the server ready <br/> 


3. Next go to your mongoDB compass and press the connect button <br/> 


4. Finally come back to the CLI and enter ``npm start``. This will run the index.js file and connect to the mongoDB server. Now you are ready to check out the routes on insomnia. <br/>
